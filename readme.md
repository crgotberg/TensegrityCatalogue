This repository contains all tensegrity primitives results found by the algorithm contained within my thesis, "Synthesis and analysis of tensegrity mechanisms" (publication forthcoming). I've included a MATLAB app for interpreting the results which will hopefully be helpful.

If you use the data contained in this repository, please attribute it (either to this repo or to one of the works in which I develop my methods which will be listed below). This data is licensed as noted on the repo so please follow all license terms as well.
